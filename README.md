# abductive-commonsense-reasoning
An updated public repository associated with [Abductive Commonsense Reasoning, ICLR 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05739)

# Setup

1. Clone the repo
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:allenai/abductive-commonsense-reasoning.git
    ```
2. Install requirements in a Python 3.7 environment
    ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download Data and Models
    ```
    sh get-data.sh
    ```
   
The script will create `data/` and `models/` directories containing subdirectories `anli` and `anlg` for the Abuctive Inference and Generation tasks respectively. The size of the data and models is around *12G*. If you'd like to download data:

    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-mosaic/public/abductive-commonsense-reasoning-iclr2020/anli.zip
    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-mosaic/public/abductive-commonsense-reasoning-iclr2020/anlg.zip
    


# Tasks
